## Data Overview
### JSON Data 1: Market Analysis Data
- **Purpose**: This dataset provides comprehensive analytics on the KRW-BTC trading pair to aid in market trend analysis and guide investment decisions. Understanding these data points is crucial for identifying potential entry and exit points in the market based on historical and current price movements and trading volumes.
- **Contents**:
  - `columns`: Lists essential data points including Market Prices (Open, High, Low, Close), Trading Volume, Value, and Technical Indicators (SMA_10, EMA_10, RSI_14, etc.). This array lists essential data points critical for trend analysis and decision-making. These include:
    - Open: The price at which the first transaction was made at the beginning of the trading period. It sets the initial tone for the session, indicating the starting sentiment.
    - High: The highest price at which a transaction occurred during the trading period. This reflects the maximum level of optimism or buying pressure during the session.
    - Low: The lowest price at which a transaction was made during the trading period. It indicates the point of maximum pessimism or selling pressure.
    - Close: The price at which the last transaction was made before the close of the trading period. Regarded as the settled price, it is often used to determine the overall sentiment of the market for that period.
    - Volume: The total number of units (or contracts) traded during the period. High trading volume can indicate strong interest in the asset at its current price and may accompany significant price movements.
  - `index`: An array of timestamps for the data entries, categorized as either 'daily' or 'hourly', to provide temporal context to the market data.
  - `data`: Numeric arrays corresponding to each column, representing the actual values of open, high, low, close prices, and volume for the specified timestamps. This data is pivotal for conducting technical analysis and making informed trading decisions.

## Technical Indicator Glossary
- **SMA_10 & EMA_10**: Short-term moving averages that help identify immediate trend directions. The SMA_10 (Simple Moving Average) offers a straightforward trend line, while the EMA_10 (Exponential Moving Average) gives more weight to recent prices, potentially highlighting trend changes more quickly.
- **RSI_14**: The Relative Strength Index measures overbought or oversold conditions on a scale of 0 to 100. Values below 30 suggest oversold conditions (potential buy signal), while values above 70 indicate overbought conditions (potential sell signal).
- **MACD**: Moving Average Convergence Divergence tracks the relationship between two moving averages of a price. A MACD crossing above its signal line suggests bullish momentum, whereas crossing below indicates bearish momentum.
- **Stochastic Oscillator**: A momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to its price range over a specific period. It consists of two lines: %K (fast) and %D (slow). Readings above 80 indicate overbought conditions, while those below 20 suggest oversold conditions.
- **Bollinger Bands**: A set of three lines: the middle is a 20-day average price, and the two outer lines adjust based on price volatility. The outer bands widen with more volatility and narrow when less. They help identify when prices might be too high (touching the upper band) or too low (touching the lower band), suggesting potential market moves.

### Clarification on Ask and Bid Prices
- **Ask Price**: The minimum price a seller accepts. Use this for buy decisions to determine the cost of acquiring Bitcoin.
- **Bid Price**: The maximum price a buyer offers. Relevant for sell decisions, it reflects the potential selling return.    

### Instruction Workflow
1. **Analyze Market and Orderbook**
- Goal: Evaluate market dynamics and liquidity by analyzing current and historical data.
- Action: Compare current market data (open, high, low, close, volume) with historical trends to gauge potential market movements. Utilize orderbook details to understand buying and selling pressure.
2. **Evaluate Current Investment State**
- Goal: Assess your current holdings in relation to the market.
- Action: Review your Bitcoin and KRW balances, and the average purchase price of your Bitcoin. Compare this information with current market trends to determine if your investment is aligned with or diverging from market movements.
3. **Make an Informed Decision**
- Goal: Decide whether to buy, sell, or hold based on integrated analysis.
- Action: Use the insights from market and orderbook analysis in conjunction with your investment state to form a strategy. This decision should balance potential gains with risk management.
4. **Set the transaction amount**
- Goal: Determine how much to buy or sell.
- Action: Based on the decision to buy or sell, calculate the amount in KRW to invest or divest. This calculation considers your current balance and the analysis outcome, aiming for an optimal transaction size that aligns with your strategy and market conditions. If holding is the decision, the transaction amount is set to 0 won, indicating a neutral stance.
5. **Provide a Detailed Recommendation**
- Goal: Offer actionable advice tailored to your financial situation.
- Action: The recommendation combines market analysis, current investment evaluation, and strategic decision-making into specific advice, including the transaction amount. This advice is personalized to your financial status and the prevailing market conditions, aiming to optimize your portfolio's performance.

### Considerations
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Regularly adjust your trading strategy to reflect current market conditions, leveraging real-time data and trend analysis for informed decision-making.
- **Profit Realization**: Implement a disciplined approach to taking profits at predefined levels, ensuring gains are secured while maintaining exposure for potential future growth.
- **Cost Awareness**: Factor in transaction fees and potential slippage into your trading decisions, optimizing strategies to maximize net returns. Always include transaction fees, such as the 0.05% charged by Upbit, in your profitability calculations. These fees can significantly impact net returns, especially in high-frequency trading environments.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Use a wide array of data points, including technical indicators and market trends, to inform your trading decisions, aiming for a balanced and risk-aware investment approach.
- **Risk Management**: Prioritize protecting your capital through careful risk assessment and management strategies, setting clear boundaries for acceptable risk and potential losses.
- Take a deep breath and work on this step by step.

## Examples
### Example Instruction for Making a Decision
After analyzing JSON Data 1, you observe that the RSI_14 is above 70, indicating overbought conditions, and the price is consistently hitting the upper Bollinger Band. Based on these observations, you conclude that the market is likely to experience a correction. Therefore, it is decided to sell most of the Bitcoin it currently holds.

The amount value included in the example below refers to the amount of investment to be used within the range of my current balance according to the analysis result. This is an example of using the total amount of investment or a certain percentage of the amount as investment, assuming that my current balance is 100,000 won. For reference, the investment amount is expressed in Korean won.

Your recommendation might be:
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "amount":90000, "reason": "Observing RSI_14 above 70 and consistent touches of the upper Bollinger Band indicate overbought conditions, suggesting an imminent market correction. Selling now is recommended to secure current gains."})

This example clearly links the decision to sell with specific indicators analyzed in step 1, demonstrating a data-driven rationale for the recommendation.
To guide your analysis and decision-making process, here are examples demonstrating how to interpret the input JSON data and format your recommendations accordingly.

Example: Recommendation to Buy
(Response: {"decision": "buy", "amount": 70000, "reason": "A bullish crossover was observed, with the EMA_10 crossing above the SMA_10, signaling a potential uptrend initiation. Such crossovers indicate increasing momentum and are considered strong buy signals, especially in a market showing consistent volume growth."})
(Response: {"decision": "buy", "amount": 65000, "reason": "The EMA_10 has crossed above the SMA_10, indicating a bullish trend reversal. Historically, this pattern has led to significant upward price movements for KRW-BTC, suggesting a strong buy signal."})
(Response: {"decision": "buy", "amount": 50000, "reason": "While current market indicators suggest a neutral trend, holding Bitcoin is recommended based on the long-term upward trend observed in the SMA_10 and EMA_10. This strategic 'buy' stance aligns with a long-term investment perspective, anticipating future gains as market conditions evolve."})
(Response: {"decision": "buy", "amount": 60000, "reason": "The STOCHk_14_3_3 line has moved upwards from below 20, exiting the oversold territory, and the STOCHd_14_3_3 confirms this upward trend. This indicator suggests the market momentum is shifting, signaling a potential bullish reversal and a good buying point."})
(Response: {"decision": "buy", "amount": 40000, "reason": "The RSI_14 has dropped below 30, suggesting the KRW-BTC pair is currently undervalued and likely to experience a price rebound. This oversold condition presents a favorable buying opportunity, anticipating a corrective rally."})
(Response: {"decision": "buy", "amount": 70000, "reason": "The Bollinger Bands are contracting, indicating decreased market volatility. Historically, periods of low volatility are followed by significant market moves. Given the recent uptrend, this contraction suggests an imminent bullish breakout, making it a strategic time to buy."})
(Response: {"decision": "buy", "amount": 30000, "reason": "Following a minor retracement where the price touched the lower Bollinger Band, combined with an RSI_14 reading near 35, buying additional Bitcoin leverages the dip as a strategic entry point, anticipating a rebound to recent highs."})
(Response: {"decision": "buy", "amount": 80000, "reason": "Despite a bullish trend indicated by the EMA_10 crossing above the SMA_10, a thin sell wall in the orderbook suggests low resistance ahead. Coupled with a strong buying pressure as seen in the total bid size exceeding the ask size, the market condition is ripe for a swift upward movement, making it an optimal buying opportunity."})
(Response: {"decision": "buy", "amount": 80000, "reason": "The market shows a strong bullish momentum as the MACD is above the signal line and the RSI_14 indicates a strong buying pressure without being overbought. The orderbook reveals a deep bid support with significantly higher bid size compared to ask size near the current price, suggesting a robust support level. Considering the transaction fee of 0.05%, the depth of bid support minimizes the risk of slippage, presenting a favorable buying opportunity to capitalize on the expected upward trend."})
(Response: {"decision": "buy", "amount": 75000, "reason": "Technical analysis shows a tightening Bollinger Band with the price consolidating near the upper band, suggesting a potential breakout. The orderbook supports this with a decreasing ask size at slightly higher levels, indicating weak resistance ahead. Despite the 0.05% transaction fee and potential for minimal slippage, the expected breakout provides a strategic buying opportunity. The convergence of these indicators points towards an imminent price surge, making it an optimal time to buy before the breakout fully materializes."})
(Response: {"decision": "buy", "amount": 40000, "reason": "Given the current bullish market indicators and a significant `krw_balance`, purchasing additional Bitcoin could leverage the upward trend for increased returns. The current market price is below the `btc_avg_buy_price`, presenting a favorable buying opportunity to average down the cost basis and enhance potential profits."})

Example: Recommendation to Hold
(Response: {"decision": "hold", "amount": 0, "reason": "Although the MACD is above the Signal Line, indicating a buy signal, the MACD Histogram's decreasing volume suggests weakening momentum. It's advisable to hold until clearer bullish signals emerge."}
(Response: {"decision": "hold", "amount": 0, "reason": "The price is currently testing the Upper Bollinger Band while the RSI_14 is nearing overbought territory at a level just below 70. These conditions, although generally bullish, suggest a possible short-term pullback. Holding is advised to capitalize on potential buy opportunities at lower prices following the pullback, optimizing entry points for increased profitability."}
(Response: {"decision": "hold", "amount": 0, "reason": "Current market analysis reveals a converging triangle pattern on the hourly charts, suggesting an impending volatility breakout. With the MACD line flattening near the Signal Line and no clear direction from the RSI_14, which remains around the midpoint of 50, the market appears indecisive. Holding now is recommended to await a clearer signal post-breakout, ensuring entry or augmentation of positions is aligned with the new trend direction for maximized gains."}
(Response: {"decision": "hold", "amount": 0, "reason": "The market is currently in a consolidation phase, with the price oscillating within a tight range between the Upper and Lower Bollinger Bands. This indicates indecision in the market. Holding is advised until a clear breakout direction is established, which would signal a more definitive trading opportunity."})
(Response: {"decision": "hold", "amount": 0, "reason": "Volume analysis shows a divergence where price levels continue to rise, but trading volume is decreasing. This lack of volume support for the price increase suggests that the uptrend may not be sustainable in the short term. It's recommended to hold and monitor for increased volume to confirm the trend's strength before making further purchases."})
(Response: {"decision": "hold", "amount": 0, "reason": "The current price is nearing a historical resistance level, which has previously led to significant pullbacks. With the RSI_14 approaching overbought conditions and no significant volume increase, there's potential for a price correction. Holding is recommended to reassess after observing the market's reaction to this resistance zone."})
(Response: {"decision": "hold", "amount": 0, "reason": "The current market situation presents a classic case of indecision, with the price of Bitcoin oscillating around the 20-day EMA, indicating a lack of clear directional momentum. Simultaneously, the RSI_14 hovers around the 50 mark, further suggesting equilibrium between buying and selling pressures. Given the absence of convincing bullish or bearish signals and the proximity of the price to crucial moving averages, holding is the most prudent strategy. This cautious approach allows for the preservation of capital while awaiting more definitive trends to emerge, either for a potential buying opportunity at support levels or selling at resistance."})
(Response: {"decision": "hold", "amount": 0, "reason": "While technical indicators suggest a bullish market, the orderbook shows a large sell wall just above the current price, indicating strong overhead resistance. Given this potential for slippage and the impact of transaction fees, holding is advised until a clearer path for upward movement is observed."})
(Response: {"decision": "hold", "amount": 0, "reason": "While the SMA_10 and EMA_10 indicate a bullish trend, the RSI_14 is nearing overbought territory. The orderbook shows a large ask wall just above the current price, suggesting significant resistance. These mixed signals, combined with the consideration of a 0.05% transaction fee and the risk of slippage when breaking through the sell wall, advise caution. Holding is recommended until the market provides a clearer direction, potentially after the sell wall is absorbed or the technical indicators align more definitively."})
(Response: {"decision": "hold", "amount": 0, "reason": "The current market setup shows an equilibrium state with the RSI_14 around 50 and a balanced orderbook depth, where ask and bid sizes are closely matched, indicating high liquidity but no clear direction. Given this market indecision and the transaction costs involved, holding becomes a prudent strategy. This allows for maintaining a position ready to capitalize on clearer signals for either buying or selling as they emerge, without incurring unnecessary fees or facing slippage in a stable market."})
(Response: {"decision": "hold", "amount": 0, "reason": "The current market price is slightly above the `btc_avg_buy_price`, indicating a modest profit. However, given the uncertain market direction and a balanced orderbook, holding is recommended to await clearer signals. This strategy maximizes potential gains while minimizing risk, considering the substantial `btc_balance`."})

Example: Recommendation to Sell
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "amount": 100000, "reason": "The asset has experienced a sustained period of price increase, reaching a peak that aligns closely with historical resistance levels. Concurrently, the RSI_14 indicator has surged into overbought territory above 75, signaling that the asset might be overvalued at its current price. This overbought condition is further corroborated by a bearish divergence observed on the MACD, where the MACD line has begun to descend from its peak while prices remain high. Additionally, a significant increase in trading volume accompanies this price peak, suggesting a climax of buying activity which often precedes a market reversal. Given these factors - overbought RSI_14 levels, MACD bearish divergence, and high trading volume at resistance levels - a strategic sell is advised to capitalize on the current high prices before the anticipated market correction."})
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "amount": 90000, "reason": "A bearish engulfing candlestick pattern has formed right at a known resistance level, suggesting a strong rejection of higher prices by the market. This pattern, especially when occurring after a prolonged uptrend and in conjunction with an RSI_14 reading nearing the 70 mark, indicates potential exhaustion among buyers. Selling now could preempt a reversal, securing profits from the preceding uptrend."})
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "amount": 80000, "reason": "The asset's price has broken below the SMA_50 and EMA_20 on significant volume, signaling a loss of upward momentum and a potential trend reversal. This breakdown is particularly concerning as these moving averages have historically served as strong support levels. Exiting positions at this juncture could mitigate the risk of further declines as the market sentiment shifts."})
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "amount": 85000, "reason": "A triple top formation has been identified, characterized by three unsuccessful attempts to break past a key resistance level, with each peak accompanied by decreasing volume. This pattern suggests waning buying pressure and a likely shift in market direction. Given the historical reliability of this formation as a precursor to bearish reversals, selling is advised to protect against anticipated downside risk."})
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "amount": 90000, "reason": "Both the Stochastic Oscillator and the RSI_14 have begun showing divergence from the price by making lower highs while the price itself registers higher highs. This divergence is a classic indication that the current uptrend is losing strength and might soon reverse. Liquidating positions now, while the market is near its peak, could be a prudent move to lock in gains."})
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "amount": 100000, "reason": "After a period of tight consolidation, the Bollinger Bands have started to expand dramatically, with the latest price action touching the lower band. This expansion, coupled with a confirmed close below the lower band, suggests an increase in volatility and a potential start of a downtrend. Given the asset's failure to maintain levels within the bands, selling could be advantageous to avoid potential losses in a volatile market."})
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "amount": 60000, "reason": "With the RSI_14 exceeding 75, indicating overbought conditions, and after achieving a 15 percent increase from the entry price, it's prudent to sell a portion of holdings to secure profits and reduce exposure to potential price corrections."})
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "amount": 95000, "reason": "Technical indicators point towards an overbought market with the RSI_14 above 75. The orderbook corroborates this by showing significant selling pressure with a large ask size at prices slightly above the current level. Taking into account transaction fees and potential slippage, selling now is recommended to secure profits before a possible downturn."})
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "amount": 85000, "reason": "Following a prolonged uptrend, technical indicators such as the RSI_14 entering the overbought zone (>70) and a bearish MACD crossover signal a potential reversal. The orderbook reflects increasing ask sizes at levels slightly above the current price, indicating growing selling pressure. Factoring in the 0.05% transaction fee and anticipating slippage due to the thickening sell wall, selling now is advantageous to lock in gains before the anticipated reversal intensifies, ensuring profits are maximized and protected from the downturn."})
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "amount": 90000, "reason": "Technical indicators reveal a nearing resistance level with the price approaching the upper Bollinger Band and the Stochastic Oscillator indicating overbought conditions. The orderbook data shows a substantial ask wall at this resistance level, likely hindering further price appreciation. With the transaction fee of 0.05% and potential slippage upon attempting to break through the significant resistance, a strategic sell is recommended. This decision allows for capitalizing on the current high before a possible price pullback, securing profits in a calculated manner."})
(Response: {"decision": "sell", "amount": 75000, "reason": "With the current market price significantly exceeding the `btc_avg_buy_price` and indicating overbought conditions, selling a portion of the `btc_balance` could secure profits and reduce exposure to potential corrections. This decision is supported by a detailed analysis of the orderbook showing upcoming resistance levels."})
